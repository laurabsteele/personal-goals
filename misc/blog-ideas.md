# Goals of a Blog
Create a place where I can post things that I find are cool or interesting.

I think the best thing to do for this would be to create a separate personal website and blog. I can host any blog type things on medium since this is only going to be a fun small part of things that I want to do. If I end up wanting to do more blogging I can look into doing a more robust system.

1. Web links that I have found with explanation why I think that they are interesting
2. Take a website off of Pinterest and break it down into patterns.
