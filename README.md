I want to be a better designer, but also learn how think like a developer. As I am working on PM work in my day job I need to really focus on technical skills on the side.

# Overarching Goals
1. Become a better designer
2. Learn how to think like a developer
3. Get better at coding
4. Get better at articulating my ideas
5. Make Health a Priority
