### Development Work

### What are the goals of my portfolio?
* Display past tasks that I have completed throughout my career
* Do I want to include information about freelancing or is it just a portfolio?
* Tell a story of who I am as a designer and where I want to go
* Showcase what I enjoy and what projects I am working on
* Develop my skills of being able to articulate and tell a story

## Values
Identify values that really matter to me. Figure out how to incorporate them into what I do for a living.
- Compassion
- Faith
- Meaningful Work
- Creativity

## Vision
Write out a vision of what my dream job would be. If I have a vision of what I want my dream job to be then I will have an easier time being able to focus my portfolio.

The problem with my vision and knowing my dream job is it would ideally be a job that can combine: web design, small amounts of front-end development, UX, and graphic design. I am not sure where a job like that falls. Maybe I just need to do more research.

## Personal story
Write out where I came from and why I am so passionate about what I do. I have been doing it for a long time, and there is nothing else I rather be doing. I'm passionate about what I do and I can write about why I am so passionate about it and how I found it.
