### Week in Review:
With the craziness of interviewing for the new job I had a hard time focusing on anything else. While I don't know if I got it and I will be moving on from my current team, or if I didn't get it and I will be staying with my team I am hoping that my nerves about it so I can feel like a person for the whole week. After the interviews end of last week I felt very drained and emotional just with the possiblity of so much change. I am hoping that those emotions can even out before family gets to town.
