### Week in Review:
I didn't do my goals at all. I sketched some ideas for my poster on Saturday, but this week was really busy because we were going to Thunderbirds game Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. It was really amazing and I had a great time (other than being exhausted). I guess I did do passion projects because I really enjoy hockey. I am just going repeat my my tasks from last week to next.
