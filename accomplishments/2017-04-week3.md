### Week in Review
This week was a great start in getting use to writing out small thing that happened during the week. I have never been much of a journaler because I always felt like I had to write pages and pages about everyday. Being able to write small amount for each day makes it much more manageable.

I was able to spend time for myself in getting projects worked on that I wanted to get done as well as getting to spend good quality time with friends and family. My trip to Chicago was one of the best trips I have had in a long time and I didn't realize how much I missed Ashlyn until I got there and got to spend that quality time.

Having small goals for career type projects make it all feel a lot more manageable and not a overwhelming task that I don't know where to start.
