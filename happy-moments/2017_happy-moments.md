I am working on goals and helping myself feel inspired. Trying not to let the overwhelming feeling because there are so many things I want to do. Starting small. One big win is I learned how github works for non-work projects!

The weather is finally turning and I was able to wear a skirt to work! It was nice to see the sun. I also finally finished wedding invitations for a friend that I have been fighting with for several months.

I got to spend the evening with Alisha and chat with her about all the things that have been going on in our lives over the last couple weeks. With so many things going on we hadn't been able to hang out together so it was a nice evening to chat, drink wine and redo my hair.

Giving blood is a good thing to do, but man it makes you tired! I gave blood at the blood drive at work and then worked on other projects in the evening. By 9 o'clock I fell into bed I was so sleepy!

Hockey games are my favorite things. Even when things are crazy at work and in life I can go and drink a cider and yell at the players who can't hear me anyway! This game was awesome, we ended up winning 11 seconds before OT started.

Vacations are wonderful, but one of the best things will always be getting to come home to my wonderful husband. He makes me feel so loved and happy whenever I around him. I had a hard day at work with taking on so much more responsibility with big clients and it felt very overwhelming but he was able to help me calm down and make everything seem so much more manageable.

Go Preds go! Only undefeated team in the playoffs with 5 wins in a row!

I started diving into my Chicago trip documentation! I am really excited about how it is starting out and think it will be a cool project to leverage to different vacations I can take. It is a good challenge to weight the pros and cons of what features would be good to have now or not worry about until later.

I presented on Ethan Marcotte presentation from An Event Apart and ROCKED it. Everyone said that I did a great job with my speed and giving good information. So that feels really good to know that I am continuing to improve in presenting. I think a big reason I felt more confident even though I was so nervous and shaking a little bit. I must have gotten some of the speaker skills from mom and dad.

Following up a good work day with a hockey friend date with sushi and a great (but stressful) hockey game is wonderful!

After traveling and having to go immediately back to work it's easy to feel overwhelmed so adding in a lazy Saturday morning then going on a long run is perfect! After getting back from my run Nathan and I went out to get errands done and ended up going to Din Tai Fung with no wait! Impromptu date night will alway be my favorite.

I love being able to be on church staff and helping run the service, but I think not having to run the service and being able to just relax is just as nice to really be able to talk to friends and not worry about how everything is running.

After another chill Sunday afternoon I went over the Henry's for a fun evening of good food, wine and lots of laughs.
