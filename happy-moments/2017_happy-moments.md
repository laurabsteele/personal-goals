I am working on goals and helping myself feel inspired. Trying not to let the overwhelming feeling because there are so many things I want to do. Starting small. One big win is I learned how github works for non-work projects!

03/18/2017
==============
The weather is finally turning and I was able to wear a skirt to work! It was nice to see the sun. I also finally finished wedding invitations for a friend that I have been fighting with for several months.

03/19/2017
==============
I got to spend the evening with Alisha and chat with her about all the things that have been going on in our lives over the last couple weeks. With so many things going on we hadn't been able to hang out together so it was a nice evening to chat, drink wine and redo my hair.

03/20/2017
==============
Giving blood is a good thing to do, but man it makes you tired! I gave blood at the blood drive at work and then worked on other projects in the evening. By 9 o'clock I fell into bed I was so sleepy!

==============
Hockey games are my favorite things. Even when things are crazy at work and in life I can go and drink a cider and yell at the players who can't hear me anyway! This game was awesome, we ended up winning 11 seconds before OT started.

- Sad leaving always

Vacations are wonderful, but one of the best things will always be getting to come home to my wonderful husband. He makes me feel so loved and happy whenever I around him. I had a hard day at work with taking on so much more responsibility with big clients and it felt very overwhelming but he was able to help me calm down and make everything seem so much more manageable.

03/26/2017
==============
Go Preds go! Only undefeated team in the playoffs with 5 wins in a row!

03/27/2017
==============
I started diving into my Chicago trip documentation! I am really excited about how it is starting out and think it will be a cool project to leverage to different vacations I can take. It is a good challenge to weight the pros and cons of what features would be good to have now or not worry about until later.

03/28/2017
==============
I presented on Ethan Marcotte presentation from An Event Apart and ROCKED it. Everyone said that I did a great job with my speed and giving good information. So that feels really good to know that I am continuing to improve in presenting. I think a big reason I felt more confident even though I was so nervous and shaking a little bit. I must have gotten some of the speaker skills from mom and dad.

Following up a good work day with a hockey friend date with sushi and a great (but stressful) hockey game is wonderful!

03/29/2017
==============
After traveling and having to go immediately back to work it's easy to feel overwhelmed so adding in a lazy Saturday morning then going on a long run is perfect! After getting back from my run Nathan and I went out to get errands done and ended up going to Din Tai Fung with no wait! Impromptu date night will alway be my favorite.

03/30/2017
==============
I love being able to be on church staff and helping run the service, but I think not having to run the service and being able to just relax is just as nice to really be able to talk to friends and not worry about how everything is running.

After another chill Sunday afternoon I went over the Henry's for a fun evening of good food, wine and lots of laughs.

04/01/2017
==============
Run for 20 minutes without stopping! It was slow, but I did it!

04/02/2017
==============
Chores done. Hockey awesome.

04/03/2017
==============
The Bible studies at church started back up and it was nice to go. I haven't been good at going as much as I used to but this study is much nicer than the past couple. Looking forward to it!

04/04/2017
==============
May the Fourth be with You!

Big storms (for Seattle) came through last night. Luckily I don't have to drive much and the trains weren't delayed when I went out. It was amazing how hard it was raining and all the flash floods. I enjoyed a while just sitting and watching out the window with Ava being confused.

04/05/2017
==============
Went over to the Henry's for Cinco De Mayo. Lots of yummy food, margaritas and watched the hockey game! While the week hasn't been overwhelmingly busy it was really nice to just relax with friends and goof off together all evening.

04/06/2017
==============
What a wonderful day! It turned into a date day all day!
- Morning hike to Twin Falls.
  - Getting rained &amp; hailed on randomly getting to the top.
  - Silly chipmunks that know children are good for dropping food
  - Little dogs so muddy they can barely walk
- Afternoon movie in south center to see Guardians of the Galaxy
- Dinner at Blue C
- Dessert at a Ben &amp; Jerry's kiosk and just chatting at the mall

04/07/2017
==============
It is always nice to see friends at a church in the mornings even when things are busy. I did head shots for the website and they all turned out pretty well! The afternoon was spent catching up on chores and making the apartment look nice again. The evening was game night with Seth and Melissa! Pie Face is way more stressful than you might think!

While it's not really a 'happy moment' I want to showcase the crazy of trying to get to work this morning. When I got to the Sounder everything seemed to be fine, but when I walked up to the the wraparound there was a semi that had hit the train tracks and the roof of it was almost sheered off. Find out about 10 minutes later that they had to do an inspection of the tracks to make sure it was stable enough for trains to go through. Since I didn't know how long that was going to take and the bus was going to take another 10 minutes to get there and then 20 minutes to get to the light rail I decided to get an Uber. Seth was with me so he came, and then I asked the group of other commuters if two more wanted to share the uber. Two random people did and we took the commute over to the light rail to get back into Seattle. I am very thankful that I have a manager who is so easy going and in a career that it doesn't matter that I come in really late. (Also good that I always come in early so barely anyone even noticed I was 30 minutes late)

Recently I have gotten to spend so much time with Nathan and it's an amazing thing. After I got home from work I was able relax and we watched 'Get Smart'. I loved it! Steve Carrell is my favorite.

04/09/2017
==============
I had a meeting with client F today and it went AMAZING. My presentation skills have improved dramatically and I feel very confident when I am talking to people. I think a big part of it is how much I am preparing for the meetings. I am writing out agenda, double-checking everything and confirming everything just to make sure a one hour meeting goes well and I really think it is paying off! My favorite part of the meeting is when I told them about a new color I wanted to add to the design. They were very unsure about it and not sure if it fit well. I was able to tell them exactly why I chose it, why I thought it was a good fit for the design, and how it fit with the art direction we were going. Even Shawn pinged me after and told me that I had done a good job. That always feels the best!

04/10/2017
==============
Grumpy. Grumps. At least I was able to be productive at work.

And just like that the good mood comes back because the Thunderbirds dominated in game 4! Game 5 is on Friday, and hopefully another big win to end the season at home!

04/10/2017
==============
So sleepy. Having two late nights in a row is so exhausting. I am ready for the weekend and just relax.

04/11/2017
==============
We went to Carissa's photography class silent auction. Some of the kids had some really good photos and I bought a cool shot of some street art from LA. The high school was a semi outdoor campus and reminded me of all the times in high school I always thought it would be cool to have an outdoor campus.

04/12/2017
==============
Last home hockey game of the season and it was such a good game! The Thunderbirds are the better team and they really showed it. Hopefully they can win the series on Sunday!

04/13/2017
==============
The first 100% lazy day I have had in month and month and months. I made pasta, did a couple chores, and spent most of the day doing a lot of nothing. Ending the evening with watching 'Spirited Away' with Nathan!

04/14/2017
==============
Church. Mother's Day. Lunch with the whole crew (Henry's, Kirby's, (soon to be) Smith's and Lewis's). Spending the afternoon getting chores done and making the apartment decent. And then the most amazing part of the weekend going over to the Kirby's and watching the Thunderbirds winning the WHL cup for the first time ever!

04/15/2017
==============
Went to the gym after work! Got all of my errands and chores done that I didn't get around to on the weekend, finishing up meal prepping and then just spending the rest of the evening relaxing. Good time to recover from lots of people over the weekend.

04/16/2017
==============
After the Ford meeting Shawn brought up that UX team is hiring and asking for recommendations and wanted to know if I was interested. I was taken aback because that would take me off her team after all of the time she has spent with me helping me grow in my career. Her being willing to let me try to move to another role because it would be good for my career felt so good! It made me be even more happy that I am on her team because I know she is going to let me thrive.

After work I went to dinner with Alisha and we ended up chatting for 3 hours at Panera it was really nice to catch up (even though it had only been like 2 weeks) and just chat about everything that has been going on.

04/17/2017
==============
Had a meeting with the UX manager! He told me that I am a candidate for an interview for sure, but they are looking at lots of people both internal and external. I do think that I have a shot at it even though I don't have as much experience as other people because I already know generally how CDK works (even though it's another team) and I am a quick learner! At the end of the meeting he mentioned that even if I don't get it I am on a good path with my career. I had told him how I paved my own path through CDK and moved onto something that I enjoyed more. He said that is a really good story to tell so I will have to pull that into my portfolio.

I went to Bible study even though I really wasn't feeling it, but it ended up being good to see everyone and I did get something out of it!

04/18/2017
==============
Caught a mild cold. Slept all evening.

04/19/2017
==============
Luckily the cold I caught was just a simple one and I was able to get back to normal! I left work a few minutes early and hit the trail! It was a simple 5k walk, but it was so nice outside as the weather is finally turning into summer and was so nice to be outside for a long amount of time!

04/20/2017
==============
I had a 100% free day! No plans! I got to do whatever I felt like in the moment. I slept in, made a good breakfast, went to the trail and walked five miles, read a book, made pasta, got chores done. It was a really great day!

04/21/2017
==============
I got to church and I found out I wasn't running media! That was exciting to have the next hour to do whatever I wanted! After church we went out to lunch with the Kirby's and it was fun to chill with them!

The rest of the day was more checking stuff off lists: chores, book reading, sketching. It was nice to have a chill, no plan filled weekend! This summer is already full of plans I am embracing the free moments I have.

04/22/2017
==============
Nathan and I had the same work schedule today and rode the train together!

Predators win!!

04/23/2017

04/24/2017
==============
I paid off my car! Also finally got the AC fixed.

04/25/2017
==============
Applied for job!

04/26/2017
==============
Played Nintendo with Nathan and got to hang out and chill for the evening.

04/27/2017
==============
Went to the Museum of Flight it was amazing and we spent almost 4 hours there it was so cool to look at everything!

04/28/2017
==============
Went to the Henry's for Memorial Day cookout!

04/29/2017
==============
Chill day and made lots of pasta!

04/30/2017
==============
Work was chill coming back after the break.

04/31/2017
==============
Got to go to Bible study!  Everyone is working through some hard stuff but since the sun has come out for the summer there is a lot more positivity. Everyone is praying for me and my interview!

05/01/2017
==============
Interview /# 1 with the PMs went amazing! I feel like if I don't get the job it is not because of something I did.
