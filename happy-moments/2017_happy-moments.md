I am working on goals and helping myself feel inspired. Trying not to let the overwhelming feeling because there are so many things I want to do. Starting small. One big win is I learned how github works for non-work projects!

The weather is finally turning and I was able to wear a skirt to work! It was nice to see the sun. I also finally finished wedding invitations for a friend that I have been fighting with for several months.

I got to spend the evening with Alisha and chat with her about all the things that have been going on in our lives over the last couple weeks. With so many things going on we hadn't been able to hang out together so it was a nice evening to chat, drink wine and redo my hair.
