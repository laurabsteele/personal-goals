# 2017 Q1 in Review

## Work
Work has been going really well this year. I have been able to find my stride and really show management and myself that I know what I am doing. While there has been many moments of imposter syndrome I really feel like I am improving in all the aspects that I have been given. I have been trusted to be the face of the Agency as well as being able to take on many projects such as being the PM for high priority client projects.

I have written up a document of all of the different tasks that I have completed throughout the year and this has been really helpful in talking to management and the people around me about what I have been doing. At the end of the FY in July when I have to write up my work evaluation I will be able to see from a career perspective what I am lacking and what I should jump into more.

The not knowing exactly what I want to do is a problem as always. I am not sure if I want to keep down the web and visual designer track, move more into development or jump into the UX world. While this has not become a real problem yet because I am able to continue my focus on all three it makes me wonder if I would be better by focusing on one and being really good at one. In my current role I am able to experiment with all three of them which has been a huge perk.

### Design Things
While I have not spent as much time in the visual web world I have been able to learn a lot of different concepts that I have never explored before. The concept of pattern design, using cards and templates has been a whole new world and after a little under a year of being immersed in it I really feel like I know what I am talking about and articulate what I am saying well when it comes to the platform. As the year moves on I would like to spend time creating my own pattern styles for personal projects so I can understand more about what goes into it instead of just taking the patterns from someone else.

### Dev Things
While I have not been in much code recently I have been able to really understand new concepts about development work that I had never seen before. Learning how to really use git, github, learning how large scale platforms are built by seeing the backend of the NG platform. All of these little things make me feel much more confident when I am looking around on the web at development topics because I understand these key concepts.

## Life Things
My outside of work life is feeling really good right now. I have a wonderful husband who is so good to me and a cat.. well who is a cat. I have a lot of upcoming vacations toward the end of the year which will give a good break between the busyness that working full-time and trying to balance everything brings.
