As the year progresses I will write a review about each quarter to give a good break on what is happening this year. At the end of the year I will spend time going over what all the different strengths and weaknesses are about the year to figure out what I should focus more on in 2018.

2017 in Review

# 2017 Q1 in Review

## Work
Work has been going really well this year. I have been able to find my stride and really show management and myself that I know what I am doing. While there has been many moments of imposter syndrome I really feel like I am improving in all the aspects that I have been given. I have been trusted to be the face of the Agency as well as being able to take on many projects such as being the PM for high priority client projects.

I have written up a document of all of the different tasks that I have completed throughout the year and this has been really helpful in talking to management and the people around me about what I have been doing. At the end of the FY in July when I have to write up my work evaluation I will be able to see from a career perspective what I am lacking and what I should jump into more.

The not knowing exactly what I want to do is a problem as always. I am not sure if I want to keep down the web and visual designer track, move more into development or jump into the UX world. While this has not become a real problem yet because I am able to continue my focus on all three it makes me wonder if I would be better by focusing on one and being really good at one. In my current role I am able to experiment with all three of them which has been a huge perk.

### Design Things
While I have not spent as much time in the visual web world I have been able to learn a lot of different concepts that I have never explored before. The concept of pattern design, using cards and templates has been a whole new world and after a little under a year of being immersed in it I really feel like I know what I am talking about and articulate what I am saying well when it comes to the platform. As the year moves on I would like to spend time creating my own pattern styles for personal projects so I can understand more about what goes into it instead of just taking the patterns from someone else.

### Dev Things
While I have not been in much code recently I have been able to really understand new concepts about development work that I had never seen before. Learning how to really use git, github, learning how large scale platforms are built by seeing the backend of the NG platform. All of these little things make me feel much more confident when I am looking around on the web at development topics because I understand these key concepts.

## Life Things
My outside of work life is feeling really good right now. I have a wonderful husband who is so good to me and a cat.. well who is a cat. I have a lot of upcoming vacations toward the end of the year which will give a good break between the busyness that working full-time and trying to balance everything brings.

Goals for the rest of 2017
==============

I did not make goals for myself at the beginning of the year. It is time to change that and make something that I can really track and be proud of. I track myself at work and know that I am going a good job, but if I did that more on a personal level I will be happier.

# 1. Become a better designer
I keep telling myself that I want to be the best designer I can be, but I have not spent the time to really know what looks good and teach myself how to create something better. I need to stop stopping at the first solution and do multiple iterations. To get better this year I will complete side projects that I actually like and not as the 'yes man' in my life if it looks good or not. I will also keep up with my hand lettering because it makes me think more about layout and typography as I come up with design solutions.

# 2. Learn how to think like a developer
This have been a struggle I have always had when it comes to development. I am not a critical thinker and am very good at just accepting what is going on around me. By asking more questions I believe this would help dramatically in the work that I am doing. In so many meetings I am the quiet one because I am not able to think as quickly. Some ways to think more critically is to read more books about it and to just do it. Ask dumb questions and try and figure out new ways to think about things.

# 3. Get better at coding
Coding has been on my back burner for so long because I have been working on PM work and other items that take priority. I am going to put coding back on the table by looking through CodePens and really understand what they are about as well as reading at least one development article a week and work through the problems they discuss. It might be a simple understanding of a new command in CSS or learning how to use JavaScript a little bit more. Any little things will help.

# 4. Get better at articulating my ideas
Slow down. I believe the reason I have a hard time articulating my ideas is because I start talking before I have really come up with a solution. When you are asked a question. Stop. Think. And then answer. I will spend more time really thinking about meetings and how I will present information when that is an option.

# 5. Put health as a priority
Continue to run or exercise at least 5 times a week. I feel so much better when I do and it is silly to continue to feel bad when I can just do something about it. At the Vegas Half-Marathon I want to be able to run it sub 3 hours.
