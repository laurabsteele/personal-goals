As the year progresses I will write a review about each quarter to give a good break on what is happening this year. At the end of the year I will spend time going over what all the different strengths and weaknesses are about the year to figure out what I should focus more on in 2018.

Goals for 2017
==============

I did not make goals for myself at the beginning of the year. It is time to change that and make something that I can really track and be proud of. I track myself at work and know that I am going a good job, but if I did that more on a personal level I will be happier.

# 1. Become a better designer
I keep telling myself that I want to be the best designer I can be, but I have not spent the time to really know what looks good and teach myself how to create something better. I need to stop stopping at the first solution and do multiple iterations. To get better this year I will complete side projects that I actually like and not as the 'yes man' in my life if it looks good or not. I will also keep up with my hand lettering because it makes me think more about layout and typography as I come up with design solutions.

# 2. Learn how to think like a developer
This have been a struggle I have always had when it comes to development. I am not a critical thinker and am very good at just accepting what is going on around me. By asking more questions I believe this would help dramatically in the work that I am doing. In so many meetings I am the quiet one because I am not able to think as quickly. Some ways to think more critically is to read more books about it and to just do it. Ask dumb questions and try and figure out new ways to think about things.

# 3. Get better at coding
Coding has been on my back burner for so long because I have been working on PM work and other items that take priority. I am going to put coding back on the table by looking through CodePens and really understand what they are about as well as reading at least one development article a week and work through the problems they discuss. It might be a simple understanding of a new command in CSS or learning how to use JavaScript a little bit more. Any little things will help.

# 4. Get better at articulating my ideas
Slow down. I believe the reason I have a hard time articulating my ideas is because I start talking before I have really come up with a solution. When you are asked a question. Stop. Think. And then answer. I will spend more time really thinking about meetings and how I will present information when that is an option.

# 5. Put health as a priority
Continue to run or exercise at least 5 times a week. I feel so much better when I do and it is silly to continue to feel bad when I can just do something about it. At the Vegas Half-Marathon I want to be able to run it sub 3 hours.
